# Algorithmic Trading in Python

The **'Standard and Poor's 500'** (S&P 500) is a stock market index tracking the stock performance of the 500 largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. The index fund is **'market captitalisation weighted'**, which essentially means that stocks of larger companies have a higher weight in the fund.

We start off by implementing strategies that assume a simpler, **'equal weight'** S&P500 fund.
